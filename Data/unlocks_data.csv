Joanne Nagel's response was ""The team agreed in our last cross-functional call that once Dry Run #2 updates are made specific to EDC changes that we will not go through this exercise again and that the EDC changes are a finite list and no more changes/updates moving forward. This was stressed to CLIN MED multiple times during the call and they agreed.""",

These data need to be added to the SDTM EG dataset to complete analysis.,SDTM ,SDTM domains: EG,SDTM mapping error and Lack of Dry Run TLF review,,,"The issue is on the ECG 12 Lead CRF. The ECG CRF is present at the Screening, Day -1, Day 2, ET & Unscheduled visits. The Day 2 ECG CRF has a hardcoded “24 hour” Planned Time Point. This specific Day 2 CRF was not annotated with the EGTPT and EGTPTNUM and the EGTPT/EGTPTNUM is not included in the SDTM dataset. This issue was not identified as part of SDTM Oversight performed by CDS and SQS or external review by Etera. Per PRA: There was no dry run of TFLs but an interim of some TFLs back in April/May of 2020. It was not caught at the time of lock because the timepoint is only applicable to Part 3 of the study and Part 1 was only included in the interim TFLs. When SDTM was initially built, there was no data applicable to this variable.",

The issue was identified during IQVIA internal Quality Control Review of TLF before the finalization. The records of “VISIT 28 DAY 392/EOS” for subject “007-0001” and “004-0001” were not included in SDTM.IS while the data was collected in raw.ADA (Visit 28 Day 392 / EOS/ET) and raw.F_ADA_MAND (evtV28D392EOS). In the program of SDTM, IQVIA Biostatistics merged raw.ADA (Vendor data) and raw.F_ADA_MAND (CRF data) by subject, visit and datetime. But it was missed to fix the value of EOS visit for merging raw.ADA and raw.F_ADA_MAND in SDTM programming after having received the new data for 2nd interim analysis. As a result, EOS visit records were not included in SDTM.IS. IQVIA Biostatistics double checked all other visits and there was no issue. Given that this is full spectrum of possible visits for this study, a similar issue will not happen in the final database lock.",SDTM,ADA,,,,,
